# Change the data type at runtime

In Java, if you try to assign a value of a different data type to a variable, you'll get a compilation error.","In Python, variables are dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to explicitly specify the data type of a variable when you declare it. Python infers the data type from the value assigned to the variable.

You can change the data type of a variable at runtime by reassigning it to a different value of a different type."
