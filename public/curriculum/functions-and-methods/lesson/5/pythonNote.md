A lambda function in Python is a concise way to create functions with a single expression, often used for small, short-lived function that serve a specific purpose and do not require a full function definition.

The syntax for a lambda function is as follows:

```lambda arguments: expression```

`lambda`: The keyword indicating the creation of a lambda function.
`arguments`: The input parameters, separated by commas (similar to the arguments of a regular function).
`expression`: The single expression that the lambda function evaluates and returns.
