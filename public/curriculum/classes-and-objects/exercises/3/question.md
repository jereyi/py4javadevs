Define a `Node` class with attributes `data` and `next_node`.

Create a `LinkedList` class with an initial empty head.

Implement the `is_empty` method to check if the linked list is empty.

Implement the `insert_at_end` method to insert a new node at the end of the linked list.

Implement the `display` method to print the elements of the linked list.

Implement the `length` method to find and return the length of the linked list.


Create an instance of the `LinkedList` class and perform the following operations:


Insert elements 5, 10, 15, and 20 at the end of the linked list.

Display the elements of the linked list.

Print the length of the linked list.
