Declare a variable `year` and assign it an integer value.
Use an `if`-`else` statement to determine if the year is a leap year.
Print the result.

(Hint: The rule is that a leap year is every 4 years 
except if the year is divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400. 
Then, the leap year is skipped. )
